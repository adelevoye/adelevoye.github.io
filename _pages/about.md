<div style="text-align: justify">  

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Yale University. My research interests are American Politics, policy-making and quantitative methods. More specifically, I explore how different institutional settings process information, evidence and science to produce policies. 
<br>
<br>
Prior to Yale, I worked for the French Treasury in the United States, following American economic and financial developments for the French Government and focusing on financial regulation, budgetary, fiscal and health issues. Iâ€™ve also worked at the House of Representatives, where I followed debates around the Dodd Frank Act and Affordable Care Act adoptions in 2010.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing or watching sports. When it comes to sports, I equally love applying statistical tools and appreciating the irrationality of it all. It's a balance I wish I could apply to my work.
