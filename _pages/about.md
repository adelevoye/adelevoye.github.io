I am a Data Scientist for GeoMatch at Stanford University's Immigration Policy Lab. Using machine learning tools and rigorous research methods and through collaborative partnership models, GeoMatch tools empower governments and immigrants with data-driven insights that recommend places where newcomers are most likely to thrive. We also conduct rigorous research that uncovers new knowledge about immigrant placement and integration to support evidence-based policy making and immigration program design.

I received my PhD in Political Science from Yale University. In my research, I explore the political and business consequences of sports leagues' and athletes' political activism. I investigate whether athletes can change minds, and whether and how their activism changes how the leagues are perceived, trying to understand the potential business and strategic consequences of activism for the leagues. In my dissertation, "Leading from the Margins: the WNBA and the emergence of a new model of sports activism in the United States", I focus on the WNBA and on how the intersectional nature of the league (mostly female, Black and queer) feed and influence their activism.

Prior to Yale, I worked for the French Treasury in the United States, following American economic and financial developments for the French Government and focusing on financial regulation, budgetary, fiscal and health issues. Iâ€™ve also worked at the House of Representatives, where I followed debates around the Dodd Frank Act and Affordable Care Act adoptions in 2010.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing or watching sports. When it comes to sports, I equally love applying statistical tools and appreciating the irrationality of it all. It's a balance I wish I could apply to my work. Some of my analytical work can be found on my blog <a href="https://angeledelevoye.wixsite.com/sips">here</a>.
