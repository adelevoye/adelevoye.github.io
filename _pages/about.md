I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Yale University. My research interests are American Politics and quantitative methods. I explore the political and business consequences of sports leagues' and athletes' political activism. I investigate whether athletes can change minds, and whether and how their activism changes how the leagues are perceived, trying to understand the potential business and strategic consequences of activism for the leagues. In my dissertation, "Leading from the Margins", I focus on the WNBA and on how the intersectional nature of the league (mostly female, Black and queer) feed and influence their activism.

In a different set of projects, I explore how different institutional settings such as the demographic composition of an institution or its resources and rules process information, evidence and science to produce policies. Current projects include investigations of these questions in Congress, School Boards and Mini Publics.

Prior to Yale, I worked for the French Treasury in the United States, following American economic and financial developments for the French Government and focusing on financial regulation, budgetary, fiscal and health issues. Iâ€™ve also worked at the House of Representatives, where I followed debates around the Dodd Frank Act and Affordable Care Act adoptions in 2010.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing or watching sports. When it comes to sports, I equally love applying statistical tools and appreciating the irrationality of it all. It's a balance I wish I could apply to my work. Some of my analytical work can be found on my blog <a href="https://angeledelevoye.wixsite.com/sips">here</a>.
