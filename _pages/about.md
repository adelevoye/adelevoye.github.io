I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Yale University. My research interests are American Politics, policy-making and quantitative methods. More specifically, I explore how different institutional settings process information, evidence and science to produce policies. 

Prior to Yale, I worked for the French Treasury in the United States, following American economic and financial developments for the French Government and focusing on financial regulation, budgetary, fiscal and health issues. Iâ€™ve also worked at the House of Representatives, where I followed debates around the Dodd Frank Act and Affordable Care Act adoptions in 2010.
